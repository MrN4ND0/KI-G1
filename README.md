# **Algorithmic foundations of machine learning and deep learning**
This repository serves as a digital extension of the scientific poster on the topic: _Algorithmic foundations of machine learning and deep learning_.
Content of the repository are code examples for the implementation of artificial neural networks in Python. The examples range from simple implementations of the mathematical foundations in "raw python", to more complex, effective approaches with modules like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), to the use of frameworks like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
Furthermore, the repository contains more and deeper information about the topics contained in the poster and additional topics that are relevant in this area.
A source reference is also included.
